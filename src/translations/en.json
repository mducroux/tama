    "<br> Your goal is to teach your student what a prallelogram is. For this, you can choose between several activities: <br><br> - Show an example: Select a shape, then tell your student if it is or not a parallelogram<br><br> - Give an exercise: Select a shape, your student has to guess if it is or not a parallelogram, then tell your student the correct answer. <br><br> - Give a lesson: explain one rule describing properties of parallelograms. <br><br> Each of these activities costs you points (indicated below the activities). You can choose an activity provided that you have enough point for this. Once you think your student knows what a parallelogram is or you no longer have points to spend, you can make your student take the final test and you'll receive your final score. <br><br> Good luck!",
